This is a console-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in Java. The game is played between the user and the computer. 
The user selects one of the three choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is determined based on the well-known rules of the game:

1. Rock beats Scissors
2. Scissors beats Paper
3. Paper beats Rock
